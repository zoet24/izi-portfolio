                                    A textile piece for the upcoming exhibition 'Wallpaper Man' with the William Morris Society and Storybox Collective. The quilt depicts a quote from Morris from over 150 years ago, demonstrating how he predicted the unsustainable nature of capitalism and the climate emergency we find ourselves in today. 'Blanketing' is a traditional ceremony held by certain indigenous communities, whereby a quilt is placed over an individual as a sign of respect and forgiveness. The term 'to blanket' also means to cover up, to stifle, and to affect everyone (as in 'blanket term'). This bears relevance to our complacency in this climate crisis - we have known about this for so long and yet have not changed and are reluctant to do so. The pattern on the quilt forms 'X' shapes and hourglasses in William Morris fabric, referencing protest, Extinction Rebellion, and how so much time has passed and the clock is ticking. In this way, the quilt links the past, present, and future, as the quilt hangs open in the exhibition space; waiting for change to come and someone to forgive.

                                    Boris Johnson’s aides admitted that they aimed the date of the October 2019 general election to restrict the student vote. The No Deal Breakfast is a touring dinner party encouraging students to register to vote. The menu consists of student-favourite foods that will rise in price if we leave the EU without a deal, demonstrating how even the most staple foods will become luxuries. Facts on the plates and prompts on the table cloth promote active and informed discussion about Brexit, helping the participants to engage with current affairs. In doing so, students can see how they will be directly affected by these changes, and know that their vote counts.

                                    ALLOT is a government-issued scheme, introducing radical changes to daily life to combat the unprecedented overpopulation of cities in 2050, which has made food, water and space scarce. All green spaces have been eradicated as ‘unnecessary’, and been replaced with high-rise tower blocks which accommodate everyone. Residents are responsible for their own food systems – each floor of a block grows different vegetables, which are given to the communal kitchen when ready. Communal eating eradicates the waste of space that private kitchens and dining rooms entail. Individual vegetable patches supplied to the residents double up as furniture for space efficiency. The vegetables themselves are genetically engineered to grow from seed to full size in two weeks, and to grow into cubes – this ensures no space is wasted when stacked, and keeps the produce the same size and weight, preventing competition between the residents.

                                    A publication that collates and questions the judgements that famous writer Iris Murdoch was subjected to by the media, both during her life and after. The paper juxtaposes serious literary criticism with media commentary on her ‘unorthodox’ relationships and affairs. The clippings date from 1969—2019, illuminating the gender discrimination Murdoch faced as a successful female writer at the time, but also in more recent years. The publication also includes the images of Murdoch used in the papers, kept to scale to connote the nature of the article they belong to – from a headline image to a back page story. In placing these depictions under review, the document aims to reinstate Murdoch’s legacy where it is deserving, rather than where it has been unjustly directed.                                    <br><br>In collaboration with Ben Hopley and Meg Turvey.

A cutlery system designed for families reluctant to come together for meals, and inspired by the console-addicted children I babysit. For every minute the family is kept waiting, the fork gets 10cm longer, and the knife 20% smaller. This makes it increasingly harder for the children to wolf their food down and return to their games, forcing them to endure family time and eventually reap the benefits of time spent together.

                                    In Saudi Arabia activists peacefully protested for the women’s right to drive. For this they were detained, tortured and sexually abused. Three women are still unjustly imprisoned. The campaign ‘Overtake Injustice’ encourages the public to show their solidarity with Loujain, Naseema and Samar. A series of road signs lead to an installation of three parking spaces; reserved for each of the activists still detained. The spaces represent the restriction placed on them as a result of their battle for something that we all take for granted. People are invited to petition for their release by plastering Amnesty bumper stickers over the road signage. Following the campaign at South Bank, we held an internal exhibition at Kingston University of the years’ projects, called ‘KSA Campaigns For’. A small group of us organised the curation, branding, and build of the show.

                                    When you blow things up to a monumental scale, important details get left behind. On the 25th March – International Day of Rememberance of the Victims of Slavery – we unveiled the hidden histories of figures commemorated as statues, whose involvement in the Transatlantic slave trade has been forgotten. We covered the statue of Robert Milligan, celebrated on the London Docklands as a ‘caring guardian’, who in fact profited from the enslavement of 526 people. On this day, members of the public would be sent their own pieces of cloth along with a website link detailing all the statues in the UK with these hidden histories, so that they can go out and join the protest.
